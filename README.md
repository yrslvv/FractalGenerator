# Newton Fractal Generator

## Overview
This project implements a Newton fractal generator using C++. The Newton fractal is a type of fractal generated by iterating a function for a given set of complex numbers. This project demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in C++, including dynamic memory management, class construction, destructors, move semantics, and operator overloading.

The core of this fractal generation is based on the **Newton-Raphson method** applied to the equation:

**f(Z) = Z^3 - 2Z + 2**

## Features
- **Newton Fractal Generation**: Generates Newton fractals using complex number arithmetic and iterative methods.
- **Memory Management**: Demonstrates manual memory management using dynamic memory allocation for the 2D grid of pixels.
- **Move Semantics and Constructors**: Includes move constructor and move assignment operator to optimize memory usage.
- **PPM File Saving**: The fractal is saved as a PPM image file, which can be opened by various image editors or viewers.
- **Exception Handling**: Custom exception handling for array access out of bounds in the `Complex` and `Pixel` classes.

## Project Structure

- **main.cpp**: Contains the main driver function that creates fractal objects, invokes the fractal generation, and saves the results as PPM files.
- **Fractal.h**: Declaration of the `Fractal` class which represents a fractal object. Contains the logic for fractal generation and saving to a file.
- **Complex.h**: Defines the `Complex` class for representing complex numbers, with support for basic arithmetic and magnitude calculation.
- **Pixel.h**: Defines the `Pixel` class which represents an individual pixel's RGB values.
- **SaveToPPM**: Function to save the fractal image as a PPM file, making it viewable in image editors.

## Dependencies
- No external libraries are required for this project.
- Standard C++ libraries: `<iostream>`, `<cmath>`, `<fstream>`
